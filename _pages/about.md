Hi! Welcome to my GitHub Pages.

I am a Senior Front End Engineer in London, UK! I am operating under my limited company, Pinecone Software Limited. I currently provide contract, freelance and project-based web services. I love to observe, research, think, and solve problems and output great work that is
excellent in design and functionality. I am also a manufacturing enthusiast, skier, and guitarist.

> This website intends to present my web development skills and services, show some examples of past projects, and partial demonstrations of several web technologies that I enjoy using. I have been constructing my posts having fellow developers in mind, and walk through my development process in detail.

I have a bachelor’s degree in Mechatronics Engineering and a master’s degree in Business Administration (MBA). (Please refer to my [CV](https://alitursucular.github.io/assets/docs/alitursucular-senior-frontend-engineer-cv.pdf) for details) I started programming in high school with Excel VBA. My very first project was a multiple-choice exam score calculator. Upon starting university, I took from basic to in-depth programming courses along with my other core engineering classes. In my sophomore year, I was introduced to Web Development and I knew that day would be the new beginning!

After graduation, two friends and I had our first entrepreneurship experience in e-commerce. We constructed a complete business design of an e-commerce website as well as its corresponding visual and full-stack implementations. Although we had managed to develop the e-commerce site from scratch, we have deeply failed in the business aspect and accepted this fact after 6 months. This failure triggered me to search for what is missing, and how I missed what is missing(!). So, I ended up studying MBA.

I wanted to learn how businesses are established and maintained around ideas and products. I believe that any kind of technical skill is super valuable. However, if those skills are not surrounded by the correct business approach, they would less likely get a chance to be realized. As being a Web Developer and an Engineer, MBA education helped me to understand how I could efficiently use my skills, observe from the eyes of the business owner, and to collaborate with the team so, I could put forward a healthy development.

Over the years, I have managed to practice my coding in various projects and business ventures. I made loads of mistakes that I am proud of because I learned a lot from them. Every business comes with its unique challenges and we should be fearless to adapt to the evolving web development world!
