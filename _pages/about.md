Hi! Welcome to my GitHub Pages. Let me tell a little bit about myself.

I have a bachelor’s degree in Mechatronics Engineering and a master’s degree in Business Administration (MBA). (Please refer to my [resume](https://alitursucular.github.io/assets/docs/ali-tursucular-resume.pdf) for details) I started programming in high school with Excel VBA. My very first project was a multiple-choice exam score calculator. Upon starting university, I took basic to in-depth programming courses along with my other core engineering classes. In my sophomore year, I was introduced to Web Development. Ever since, I was involved in tons of assignments and projects. This GitHub Page intends to present my skills, show some examples of past projects and partial demonstrations of several web technologies that I enjoy using.

After graduation, two friends and I experienced an e-commerce entrepreneurship. We built a complete business design of an e-commerce website and its corresponding visual and full-stack implementations. Although we managed to complete the site technically, we deeply failed in the business aspect after 6 months. This failure triggered me to search for what is missing and how we missed what is missing(!). So, I ended up in MBA.

I wanted to learn how businesses are established and maintained around ideas and products. I believe that, any kind of technical skill is super valuable. However, if those skills are not surrounded by correct business approach, they less likely get chance to be realized. As being a Web Developer and an Engineer, MBA education helped me to understand how I could efficiently use my skills, how to see things from the customer (or the business) side and how to collaborate with team so, we could present a healthy development.

-A little bit of philosophy:
Over the years, I have managed to practice my coding in various projects and business ventures. I made loads of mistakes that I am proud of. I learned a lot from them and never repeat the same mistake. Web development evolves so fast and most new features, tools, libraries, frameworks etc. builds upon each other. This is great because the environment is dynamic. One cannot survive long in a dynamic environment by remain static. Therefore, ground up knowledge, analytical thinking, teamwork, collaboration, research skills, hunger to learn and communication skills are highly important.
