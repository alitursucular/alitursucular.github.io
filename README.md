# Hello!

Welcome to my GitHub Pages!

I am a contract Senior Front End Engineer in London, UK. I am operating under my limited company, Pinecone Software Limited. I currently provide contract, freelance and project-based web services. For more information, please feel free to take a look at my meticulously crafted company website [https://pineconesoftware.co.uk/](https://pineconesoftware.co.uk/)

This GitHub page [https://alitursucular.github.io](https://alitursucular.github.io/) *(aka my professional blog)* intends to present my skills, show some examples of past projects, and provide partial demonstrations of several web technologies that I enjoy using. I have been constructing my posts with fellow developers in mind and sharing my development process in my blog posts. Please [check it out](https://alitursucular.github.io/)!<br/><br/>
