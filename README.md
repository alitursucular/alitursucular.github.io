# Hello!

Welcome to my GitHub Pages!

I am a Front End Engineer and a contractor in London, UK. I am operating under my limited company, Pinecone Software Limited. I currently provide contract, freelance and project-based web services.

This GitHub page [https://alitursucular.github.io](https://alitursucular.github.io/) intends to present my skills and services, show some examples of past projects, and partial demonstrations of several web technologies that I enjoy using. I have been constructing my posts having fellow developers in mind, and walk through my development process in detail. Please [check it out](https://alitursucular.github.io/)!<br/><br/>
