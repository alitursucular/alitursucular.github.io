For quick starters, here is the [link](http://www.depack.com.tr/en/) to the site.

This post is about a complete corporate website design work. Before I begin talking about the site, let me explain a little bit about '_A to Z web development service_' I provide first.

_If you are willing to view the site immediately, please see the [site](http://www.depack.com.tr/en/)._ **_Once you open the page, please go through developer tools of your browser and see my mark at the beginning of the HTML._**

I usually give a complete web service to my customers (if it is what I was asked for). By saying complete web service; I first set up a meeting with my customer at their office. I see their office, team, their business, decoration, their outfit, preferred colors etc. By seeing so, I create a virtual image of their style and business flow. This approach enables me to make custom development and lets me to save huge amount of time. What I believe about communication is; rather than what you tell people, what they understand matters. So actually, I help myself to understand the exact need by involving to their habitat and listening them. Most outsourced projects do not work with a graphic designer, so I choose several templates and present them. If customer also requires a content management integration, I make my selections accordingly. Other than that, I focus on latest bootstrap based templates for the base. Sometimes customers do not prefer templates, in that case I work with a graphic designer friend, unless they provide me the graphic design. Since I started my career before bootstrap type structures, native coding HTML5 and CSS3 is not a problem.

_Note that, each customer / request is different. Above mentioned flow involves not only web development work but also, web consultancy. Almost every option is on the table where, customer gets to decide which suits them the best._

To begin with, this customer asked for a full web service. I presented them +15 corporate templates which, suits to their business and requests. Depack Packaging is a leading _plastic netting_ company from Turkey. Considering their customer profile and business intensity, they needed a powerful _homepage_, individual _product pages_ and _request a quote_ page mainly for their international customers. I used _PHP_ to power up request and contact forms. Once forms are submitted, company officials receive an email. In addition to that, several pages are equipped with PHP _mobile detection_ class to serve the content. Note that, almost every template work requires a full understanding of the structure and plenty of coding to adjust components and styles.

**Homepage:** As I have mentioned above, they needed a powerful homepage. A responsive slider, short version of about us page, their featured products (as well as other products group), testimonials, recent blog posts and a footer with plenty of information. Landing user gets to review the website in couple of seconds and navigates easly to other pages. When on mobile, company address on footer directs user to _Google Maps_ and telephone number automatically prompts a _dial_ screen.

**Product pages:**
Since they have many products, i built a page for each product. Although they share a similar layout, each page has unique high-quality images and 'to the point' text explanations. I shot and photoshopped<sup>1</sup> some of the photos and, I drew & render some on the computer.

**Blog pages:**
I always paid attention to [blog pages](http://depack.com.tr/en/blog/) on sites with static content. It is normal to have a static content. However, search engines may not treat you as you would expect. Having blog content will give you the value you deserve, as well as strengthen your relationship with your customers. Statistically speaking, when blog posts of this website are combined with the email campaign, we have reached high click rates worldwide.

**Request a quote:**
[This page](http://depack.com.tr/en/request-a-quote) has been one of the major breakthroughs for their online activities. This request form is a custom built 'walk you through' type of structure. Basically, the user starts by selecting one of their products and the rest of the options open up accordingly. Each product selection comes with 'information box' and some cases have informative image links where dimensions are explicitly outlined. If a user tries to submit the form without filling all mandatory fields, our page kindly warns and specifies the problem. Once the warning has been corrected, the user can continue to submit without losing any existing data.

**Product and packaging dimensions:**
As I have mentioned above, this page has been one of the best use cases of _PHP mobile detection_ among the whole project. If you open [the page](http://depack.com.tr/en/product-and-packaging-dimensions) on a desktop, you will see 6 columns on the table. On the other hand, if you look it up on a mobile device, there is only 1 column. Rather than forcing the user to find content by getting lost in the viewport, I directly put it in front of them. Rest of the optimization is done via media queries for that specific page<sup>2</sup>.

**Contact:**
I have never enjoyed complex contact pages. Luckily, my customer didn't either. So, I built a very basic form, placed google maps and a piece of address information. Showing maps on company websites could be quite tricky. It is because maps screen allows us to move over the map. However, if you are on a mobile device, user may not want to move over the map but scroll up/down the page. That creates a conflict. If you take a look at [this](http://depack.com.tr/en/contact) page and want to move over the map, you will be notified to use 2 fingers to move it.

In addition to everything, the site is equipped with meta tags and google analytics. I did all their webmasters work, submitted their sitemaps and ran inspections over the code. Moreover, each link is suitable for social media sharing. If you copy the link and paste it on Facebook or LinkedIn, meta tags do their job, read related information and image regarding that page. Lastly, depack.com.tr has knowledge graph built in; so search engines can enhance their results not only by crawling but also, checking knowledge sources that I provide.

<sup>1</sup> _I have enough Adobe Photoshop skills on layers, image adjustement, masking, filters, transform tools, image quality, file formats etc._<br/>
<sup>2</sup> _You may have noticed [box images](http://depack.com.tr/images/depack-big-box-dimensions.jpg) by the end of the page. These images are 3D solid models of actual boxes that they use. I designed and rendered them in SolidWorks, corrected a little bit in Photoshop for the desired output._
